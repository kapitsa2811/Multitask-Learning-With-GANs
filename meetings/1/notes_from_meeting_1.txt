MTL:
	Try smaller datasets.
	Don't worry too much about initialisations, they shouldnt effect learnign too much. If they do, this is a sign of an unstable architecture.
	Make sure you do a full pass on each task for each epoch.
	Halve learning rate (just for shared layers?).
	Don't compromise too much on complexity for training time.

CGAN:
	Explore well - check differences between coarse/fine.
	Interpolation in latent space of coarse and fine.

Evaluation:
	Use humans iof necessary.

Writing:
	Pitch to peers. As if writing paper.
	Take time only on important background.
	Work within bounds of word count.
